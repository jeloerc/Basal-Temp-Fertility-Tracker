# Basal-Temp-Fertility-Tracker
The Basal Body Temperature (BBT) Tracker is designed to help individuals monitor and analyze their daily basal body temperatures throughout their menstrual cycle. By tracking these temperatures over time, users can gain insights into their fertility patterns and menstrual health.

**Overview:**
The Basal Body Temperature Tracker offers the following features:

1.Logging Morning Temperature: Users can log their morning temperature for each day of their menstrual cycle. The program records these temperatures and associates them with the corresponding cycle day.

2.Menstrual Cycle Analysis: The program provides a comprehensive analysis of the logged temperature data. It calculates the average basal body temperature for the entire cycle and identifies the fertile days based on user-defined temperature thresholds.

3.Temperature History Display: Users can view a history of their logged temperatures, indicating the temperature values for each day of their menstrual cycle. The displayed days adjust based on the length of the menstrual cycle, offering a clear visualization of the data.

4. Data Plotting: The program generates a graphical plot that illustrates the temperature fluctuations across the menstrual cycle. The fertile threshold is indicated on the plot for reference.

WILL NEED CUSTOMIZATION for individual users:

Cycle Length Adjustment: Users may need to adjust the length of their menstrual cycle. by editing the display temp list function
Fertile Temperature Setting: Users also need to set their own fertile temperature threshold.

Note: Proper data collection and interpretation are key to obtaining accurate results. Consistent logging of morning temperatures and understanding the context of temperature fluctuations is essential for meaningful analysis.

Feel free to adapt and expand on this description according to your project's specific details and any additional features you might want to highlight.
